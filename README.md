# banking-app

The project will evolve each week.
Week 1: A banking console app featuring MVC design pattern

1. Use layered architecture (abstracted files under SOLID principles) to make an MVC banking application.

2. Create a user login system (no DB necessary, use in program memory).

3. Once logged in, have a user menu display in console.

4. Allow user to make:
a. Deposit
b. Withdrawl
c. Funds Transfer
d. 5 recent transaction history
e. Display customer information
f. Sign out

5. Apply business logic to handle illegal operations in:
a. login system
b. Transactions (withdrawls /
depsosits, etc.)
